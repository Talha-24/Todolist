Hooks: 
   Hooks are the Functional Components (Function ) React which provides the special and powerful Features 
   for StateManagement
StateManagement:
 The change in state from one value to another value
 score =0       name = "Talha"
                name = "Mohammad Talha (React Developer)"
 score = 1
 The change of value from 0 to 1 is called state Change





 /*
 In the early times, we have Class Components in React which was even more complicated.
 But today, we have Functional Components(As the name is showing it is related to functions) that is quite easy because we can perform tasks by 
 use of functions in short in the modern react we use Functional Components that makes the work 
 flow easy.

Fragments:
         Fragements are empty tags which we use in return statement of a function
         to add the multiple inner elements
         <>  /Framents
         h1
         h2   //InnerElements

         
         
         </>   //Fragments
